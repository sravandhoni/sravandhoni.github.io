Paragraph
By writing regular text you are basically writing a paragraph.

This is a paragraph.

Headings

#### Heading 4

Emphasis
Modifying text is so neat and easy. You can make your text bold, italic and strikethrough.

Using two asterisks **this text is bold**.  
Two underscores __work as well__.  
Let's make it *italic now*.  
You guessed it, _one underscore is also enough_.  
Can we combine **_both of that_?** Absolutely.
What if I want to ~~strikethrough~~?

Blockquote
Want to emphasise importance of the text? Say no more.

> This is a blockquote.
> Want to write on a new line with space between?
>
> > And nested? No problem at all.
> >
> > > PS. you can **style** your text _as you want_.
This is a blockquote. Want to write on a new line with space between?

And nested? No problem at all.

PS. you can style your text as you want. :

Images
The best way is to simply drag & drop image from your computer directly. You can also create reference to image and assign it that way.
Here is the syntax.

![text if the image fails to load](auto-generated-path-to-file-when-you-upload-image "Text displayed on hover")

[logo]: auto-generated-path-to-file-when-you-upload-image "Hover me"
![error text][logo]
text if the image fails to load

error text

Links
Similar to images, links can also be inserted directly or by creating a reference. You can create both inline and block links.

Code
You can cerate both inline and full block code snippets. You can also define programming language you were using in your snippet. All by using backticks.

    I created `.env` file at the root.
    Backticks inside backticks? `` `No problem.` ``

    ```
    {
      learning: "Markdown",
      showing: "block code snippet"
    }
    ```

    ```js
    const x = "Block code snippet in JS";
    console.log(x);
    ```

}
const x = "Block code snippet in JS";

Lists
As you can do in HTML, Markdown allows creating of both ordered and unordered lists.

Ordered List
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. React

Unordered List

Mixed List
You can also mix both of the lists and create sublists.
PS. Try not to create lists deeper than two levels. It is the best practice.

1. Learn Basics
   1. HTML
   2. CSS
   7. Javascript
2. Learn One Framework
   - React 
     - Router
     - Redux

Table
Great way to display well-arranged data. Use "|" symbol to separate columns and ":" symbol to align row content.

| Left Align (default) | Center Align | Right Align |
| :------------------- | :----------: | ----------: |
| React.js             | Node.js      | MySQL       |
| Next.js              | Express      | MongoDB     |
| Vue.js               | Nest.js      | Redis       |
Left Align (default)	Center Align	Right Align
React.js	Node.js	MySQL
Next.js	Express	MongoDB
Vue.js	Nest.js	Redis
Task List
Keeping track of the tasks that are done, and those that need to be done.

Jump to section
You can give ID to a section so that you can jump straight to that part of the file from wherever you are.

[Jump to a section with custom ID](#some-id)

...

<a name="some-id" />

##### Section with some ID
Jump to a section with custom ID

Horizontal Line
You can use asterisks, hyphens or underlines (*, -, _) to create horizontal line.
The only rule is that you must include at least three chars of the symbol.

First Horizontal Line

***

Second One

-----

Third

_________

HTML
You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown file. Most of the times that will work well, but sometimes you can experience some differences that you are not used to when working with standard HTML. Using CSS will not work.
